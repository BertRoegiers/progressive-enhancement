    <h2>
      The story
    </h2>

      <blockquote>
        Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <span class="villagers">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</span> The farmer said, <span class="farmer"> <em>“Maybe.”</em></span> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <span class="villagers">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</span> The farmer again said,<span class="farmer"> <em>“Maybe.”</em></span>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,<span class="villagers"> “Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span></span>, and the farmer responded, <span class="farmer"><em>“Maybe.”</em></span> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <span class="villagers">“Isn’t that great!”</span> Again, he said,<span class="farmer"><em>“Maybe.”</em></span>
      </blockquote>

          The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.

  <h2>
    Conclusion
  </h2>
    <p><span class="paragraph1">
      <span class="Good">Good</span> and <span class="Bad">bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
